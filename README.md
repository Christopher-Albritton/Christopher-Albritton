Hello! I'm Chris,a professional data analyst with experience on more than 7 technical projects. My skills include business analystics, SQL, and data visualization and storytelling through Tableau and Power BI. I'm looking forward to leveraging my skills to dive into big data and come out with impactful visualizations, helping propel all stakeholder's goals forward such as a clear plan of growth and boosting sales.

In June of 2024, I enrolled into TripleTen's 4 month Business Intelligence Analyst program. The 7 Sprint curriculum covered, Excel/Business Analytics, SQL, Tableau and Power BI. Each Sprint wrapped up all the lessons with a project based on real world scenarios.

During my learning journey, I also participated in TripleTen's 2024 September "Code Pudding". We had the choice of picking one of some very different data sets. My team ended up rolling with the publicly available Palmer Archipelego data on three types of penguins - Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Our goal was to find out if there were any major diffferences between the Adelie populations on the three islands available. Then we dove in further to see if there were any major differences between the species that shared an island.

Some facts about me:
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python to add to my repertoire.
- Like many people in tech I'm sure, I am a gamer as well. Right now I am knee deep in Space Marine 2 but also enjoy RTS games like Age of Mythology: Retold and Total War:WH3. PC > Consoles all day.
- I have two dogs, a Husky on the smaller side (45 lbs) and a small Aussiedoodle (about 25 lbs).
- I cannot wait to leave Florida (born and raised) and move a bit north. I'm currently considering Stone Mountain, GA | Columbia, SC | or Winston-Salem, NC.
- Goal for 2025: Buy a home in one of the locations above so I can plant roots and grow from there!
